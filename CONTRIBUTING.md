# CONTRIBUTING

- `src` *.yaml files should be written according to the [v3.0/schema.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/schemas/v3.0/schema.json)
- `dist` Do not rewrite this file as it is an automatically generated OpenAPI file.
- `dist` Do not include this in the pull request due to potential conflicts.

I'm using openapi-generator with a dart-dio build.
It is desirable to pass these tests.
Untested pull requests are welcome, as Dart's development population is very small.
